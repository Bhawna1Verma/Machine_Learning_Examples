# Machine_Learning_Examples
Machine learning Pytorch and Tensorflow example codes
1. MNIST_DATA_Model.py : (Python 3.9 version ) MNIST data (28*28) -> Conv2d+FC layer pytorch implementation example -> Accuracy 91%
2. Simple RNN: (Python 3.11 version) # # Introduction to Logistic Regression in PyTorch: to build a very simple neural network in PyTorch to do handwritten digit classification.
3. Word_Embedding_SWEM_RNN_LSTM_GRU.py (Python 3.11)  -> SENTIMENT ANALYSIS Example
   code from 4A coursera.
   How the word to embeddings are obtained.
   Embeddings are trained
   SWEM model is created on the embeddings
   RNN model is created and trained
   Parameter Comparision for RNN. LSTM, GRU
4. SentimentAnalysisNLP.py (Python 3.11 version ) ## Sentiment Analysis
      https://github.com/DenysLins/introduction_to_machine_learning/blob/master/4B_Natural_Language_Processing_Assignment.ipynb 4A Jupyter notebook 
      Load the file and pull out words and embeddings
      
5. Reinforcement learning examples using OpenAi GYM (ReinforcementLearningCartpole.py and ReinforcementLearningFrozenLake.py): coursera examples
6. Chatbot using sklearn and nltk libraries (chatbotMain.py) : reading from chatbot.txt : based on cosine similarity
